# Restaurant App

Web app using React, MongoDb, Express, NodeJS, Ant Design, and Tailwind CSS to track visited restaurants in a list view.

The app allows for navigating to a location category (e.g. Dallas/Fort Worth) to view only restaurants in that location. Filters by city/neighborhood, type, rating, and cost are then available to trim the list down to find the desired restaurant. When creating a restaurant, it is scoped to that location category and you can add all the attributes that describe that restaurant. Locations are managed in a separate page where you can add cities which are then tied to the location category (or a new one is created).
